        <h2>About</h2>
    <p>In the story <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Princes_of_Serendip">The Three Princes of Serendip</a>, from which emerged the concept of serendipity, Giaffer is the king of Serendip who sent his three sons explore the world.
    </p>

    <p>Giaffer is based on an idea by <a href="http://ludism.org/tinfoil">Ron Hale Evans</a> in the chapter <em>Integrate your Interests</em> of his book <em>Mindhacker</em>. Its goal is to facilitate the discovery of new web pages by combining search terms related to topics randomly selected from a list of pre-defined interests. "With this hack you can take common ideas and fuse them using 'interest integrator' software to generate extraordinary, unpredictable results."

    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
    You first need to establish your own list of interesting topics: for each topic, set its name and its associated search terms. You will not have to re-enter this information when you return to this page as they are saved in your browser (with no need of account creation). 
    </p>
    <p>
    Go back to the home page to initiate a random selection and start a search.
