    <p>In the fairy tale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Princes_of_Serendip">The Three Princes of Serendip</a>, the king Giaffer sends his three sons to explore the world, hoping they gain wisdom. Inspired by this story, Horace Walpole coined the concept of <em>serendipity</em>
    </p>
    <p>
    Giaffer's goal is to facilitate the discovery of new Web pages by combining search terms related to subjects randomly selected from a list of pre-defined interests.
    </p>
    <p>It is a web implementation of <em>Integrate your Interests</em>, a hack by <a href="http://ludism.org/tinfoil">Ron Hale Evans</a> from his book <em>Mindhacker</em>.</p>
