# ng-devstack v0.2.1

#### Everything a front-end developer needs to simplify building AngularJS applications.

## Why ng-devstack?

This project has been inspired by another great concept [ngBoilerplate](http://joshdmiller.github.io/ng-boilerplate/), allowing to create modern web applications in AngularJS. It follows all the best practices introduced in ngBoilerplate such as component/feature-oriented directory structure, intelligent build system, etc. However, I decided to improve it a little bit and create my own boilerplate from scratch since I missed some basic features like:

- watch for any file changes and apply them to the project in real-time,
- image optimization,
- remove redundant code on compiling output HTML,
- plus ngBoilerplate hasn't been updated for months.

Now this all has been made possible. Please welcome **ng-devstack**!

## Features

- integration with gulp,
- package management with Bower,
- feature-oriented directory structure,
- LiveReload fully handled server-side with NodeJS/Express (without installing additional extensions for browsers),
- watch for file changes (scripts, styles, templates, assets) and apply them to the project on the fly,
- caching AngularJS templates to avoid additional server requests,
- pre-minifying AngularJS files to fix AngularJS' dependency injection upon minification,
- support for SASS (including Twitter Bootstrap official port to SASS),
- support for JSHint,
- JS/CSS/HTML minification,
- remove logging (`console.log()`, etc.) from compiled JS code,
- image optimization (see [Additional Info](#additional-info) for details),
- `html5Mode` support (see [Additional Info](#additional-info) for details),
- integration with AngularUI Router & AngularUI Bootstrap.

## Requirements

- Ruby
- NodeJS
- Bower

## Installation

**1.** Install SASS:

```sh
$ gem install sass
```

**2.** Install gulp globally, which is giving access to gulp's CLI:

```sh
$ npm install gulp -g
```

**3.** Install gulp locally to the project with other required plugins:

```sh
$ npm install
```

**4.** Install required libraries:

```sh
$ bower install
```

## Usage

To build the application simply type:

```sh
$ gulp build
```

For development purposes, run watch task to build and start local web server with LiveReload:

```sh
$ gulp watch
```

Deploy the production version by running `gulp compile`, or simpler:

```sh
$ gulp
```

## Additional info

All styles (as well as scripts and templates) added to `src/app/` and `src/common/` should be included to the project automatically - except to `src/sass/` folder. Files put into `src/sass/` must be manually imported in `src/sass/main.scss` file (you may want to set custom order for loading your styles). If files located in `src/sass/` are not imported in `src/sass/main.scss`, they will not work!

Vendor files downloaded with Bower can be added to project by editing `'vendor_files'` section in `config.json` file. The rest of this file should remain unchanged.

If you would like to enable AngularJS HTML5 mode, you have to uncomment 2 lines in `src/app/app.js` and `server.js`:

- `src/app/app.js`:

>
```sh
// $locationProvider.html5Mode(true);
```

- `server.js`:

>
```sh
// app.use(require('connect-modrewrite')(['!\\.\\w+$ /index.html']));
```

In addition, image optimization is turned off by default but in case you need it, don't hesitate to remove comment from the following line in `gulpfile.js`:

>
```sh
// .pipe(plugins.imagemin({ optimizationLevel: 5, progressive: true }))
```

## Known issues

- Outdated libsass in node-sass. This is a main cause of a bug with compiling Twitter Bootstrap SASS to CSS (see [this](https://github.com/andrew/node-sass/issues/233) thread and [this](https://github.com/dlmanning/gulp-sass/issues/1) for details). **Not a gulp-sass issue**! Temporarily using Ruby version (slower but stable).

## TODO

- replace Ruby SASS compiler with NodeJS equivalent
- add support for external sources in vendor files (http://*)
- add source maps support for SASS & JS
- add authorization service
- add E2E testing (Karma/Protractor)
- improve images/SVG optimization
